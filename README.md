# WebApp: Trade Evaluation
[**Application Features**](#features)
| [**Requirements**](#requirements)
| [**Project components**](#components)

- I started investing on stock market 8 years ago and always wanted to make a comprehensive assessment of my portfolio performance. However, the only thing my broker could provide was the status quo of my portfolio and its holdings. Not much has changed until today.
- Sometimes, I also learn from somewhere very interesting investment strategies and stock picks but did not have a tool to keep track their performance for future usage.
- Today, with enough technical skills, I want to build an application that enables investors to manage hypothetical portfolios, experiment investment strategies, and automate their risks/returns performance assessment.
- Beside the above motivation, I also consider [Trade Evaluation](https://sphanfinance.com/1) a means of demonstrating my technical skills and financial knowledge to the recruiters.
